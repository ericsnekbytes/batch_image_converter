# Batch Image Converter (Tentative Title)

*NOTE: This project is in-progress*

Want to easily convert a lot of images to others formats? This project is for you!

## How Does it work?

### Step 1: Pick a folder with some images

Choose what file extensions to search for, and you'll get a list of images scheduled for conversion.

### Step 2: Pick a save/output folder

Choose where to save the converted/processed images, and what format(s) to save to. Conflicting filenames
will be resolved automatically by appending "conflicting_name.0001.jpg" number suffixes to the input filename.

### Step 3 (Optional): Add modifiers

Scale your images or add other modifiers (percent scaling is the only modifier currently).

# That's it!

Use the "Start Conversion" button to begin. You'll get a status bar, and a log file with a status for each file.
